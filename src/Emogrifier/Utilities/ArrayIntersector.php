 * When computing many array intersections using the same array, it is more efficient to use `array_flip()` first and

 * {@link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6329211/php-array-intersect-efficiency Stack Overflow} for more
 * information.
 *
 * Of course, this is only possible if the arrays contain integer or string values, and either don't contain duplicates,
 * or that fact that duplicates will be removed does not matter.
 *
 * This class takes care of the detail.
